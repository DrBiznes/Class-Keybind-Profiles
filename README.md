# Class Keybind Profiles

![CKPbanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f02ea832-1d79-4a10-8785-fd3b48dd1229)


No more fumbling for the right spell key when you switch from your Warrior to your Mage! Class Keybind Profiles let's you save unique keybind setups for each class and automatically switches between them for you. Made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft.](https://github.com/bob10234/World-of-Wynncraft)

## What's Up?

- Automatically detects your current Wynncraft class
- Switches to the corresponding keybind profile you created
- Works with Wynntils, Wynncraft Spell Caster, and BetterWynnMacros

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download and install Wynntils or Wynncraft Spell Caster or BWM
3. Download the latest version of Class Keybind Profiles from the versions page
4. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder

## Configuration

### Commands

Class Keybind Profiles includes several commands to manage your keybind profiles:

- `/ckp help` - Shows all available commands
- `/ckp profiles` - Lists all classes and shows whether they have a saved profile
- `/ckp save` - Saves your current keybinds as a profile for your selected class
- `/ckp save <className>` - Saves your current keybinds as a profile for the specified class
- `/ckp delete <className>` - Deletes the saved profile for the specified class
- `/ckp nuke` - Deletes all saved profiles

You can also configure Class Keybind Profiles using Mod Menu. Just set your keybinds in the normal controls settings then go to the Mod Menu page for CKP and change "Save current keybinds" to YES for all classes you want to apply your current keybind setup to, then hit Save & Exit to actually save the profiles. Make sure to disable Wynntils spell macros feature.
