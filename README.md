# Class Keybind Profiles

![CKPbanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f02ea832-1d79-4a10-8785-fd3b48dd1229)


No more fumbling for the right spell key when you switch from your Warrior to your Mage! Class Keybind Profiles let's you save unique keybind setups for each class and automatically switches between them for you. Made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft.](https://github.com/bob10234/World-of-Wynncraft)

## What's Up?

- Automatically detects your current Wynncraft class
- Switches to the corresponding keybind profile faster than you can say "For Fruma!"
- Saves your custom keybind profiles for each class
- Configurable settings via Mod Menu (because who doesn't love options?)
- Works seamlessly with Wynntils and Wynncraft Spell Caster

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download and install Wynntils
3. Grab the Wynncraft Spell Caster mod (it's the spell to our bind)
4. Disable Wynntils spell macros in Wynntils settings if you have it enabled.
5. Download the latest version of Class Keybind Profiles from the versions page
6. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder

## Configuration

You can configure Class Keybind Profiles using Mod Menu. Just set your keybinds in the normal controls settings then go to the Mod Menu page for CKP and change "Save current keybinds" to YES for all classes you want to apply your current keybind setup to, then hit Save & Exit to actually save the profiles. Make sure to disable Wynntils spell macros feature.

## Usage

Once installed, the mod "just works" automatically when you join Wynncraft. Switch classes, and watch in awe. You'll see a toast notification when your keybinds update, because who doesn't love toast?
